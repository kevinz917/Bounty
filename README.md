## About Bounty

Bounty is a Ethereum based Q&A platform where you can get rewarded in Eth for your answers. You can propose a question **(challenge)** with Eth attached as the bounty as well as a time duration on when the challenge ends. Others can then answer your question by submitting responses **(submissions)**, and everyone is free to vote on submissions. When time runs out, anyone can **trigger a function** to settle payments algorithmically based on who received the most votes. Enjoy!
